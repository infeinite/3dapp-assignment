                <h2>About Sprite</h2>
                <p>
                    Sprite is a refreshing, lemon-lime flavored soft drink that has been a favorite among consumers since it was first introduced by The Coca-Cola Company in 1961. Known for its crisp, clean taste and invigorating effervescence, Sprite is the perfect beverage for quenching thirst and revitalizing the senses.

                    The origin of Sprite can be traced back to its predecessor, a German soda called Fanta Klare Zitrone, which was developed in the 1950s. Recognizing the potential for a lemon-lime soda in the global market, The Coca-Cola Company introduced Sprite, which quickly gained popularity and became a staple in the soft drink industry.
